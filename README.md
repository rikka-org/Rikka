# Rikka
Rikka is a fast, powerful, and extendable Discord modification. It can load plugins, manage plugins, and features a rich API.

## About the Rikka project
Rikka was created as a true FOSS modification to Discord. Unlike BetterDiscord or Powercord, Rikka is licensed under permissive licenses, that allow anyone to make their own derivatives of it.
While both BD and Powercord are open source, they are not licensed in such a way that would permit one to create their own version of them.
