# Rikka
Rikka is a fast, powerful, and extendable Discord modification. It can load plugins, manage plugins, and features a rich API.

## About the Rikka project
Rikka was created as a true FOSS modification to Discord. Unlike some client mods, Rikka is licensed under a copyleft license, that allow anyone to make their own derivatives of it.
While most client mods are open source, some are not licensed in such a way that would permit one to create their own version of them.
