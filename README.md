# Rikka
Rikka is a fast, powerful, and extendable Discord modification. It can load plugins, manage plugins, and features a rich API.

## About the Rikka project
Rikka was created as a true FOSS modification to Discord. Unlike BetterDiscord, Rikka is licensed under a permissive license, that allow anyone to make their own derivatives of it.
While both BD and Powercord are open source, BD is not licensed in such a way that would permit one to create their own version of them. 
Update: Powercord is licensed under a permissive license now, but they still restrict users in using plugins with their plugin guidelines.
